# Automarker
Upgrading note:
  1. Give extensions to due times for individuals.
  2. Different time limits per programming language. E.g. Python could be 1.5 the amount of time required for a Java/C++ submission.
  3. Admin delete submissions to allow students more submission limit or correct mistake from scoreboard. One solution is to have the cell entries on the scoreboard clickable and go to the search page listing submissions for that entry. Then for Admin have a checkbox to delete desired items on the search page.
  4. Have problem marks a function of the number of submissions. Customizable by lecturer.
  5. Restrict assignments to a subset of the supported automarker languages.
  6. Restrict source submission filesize to catch static table lookup method.
  7. Problem verifiers. Instead of relying on unique answers have the ability to supply a program checker/verifier for a problem.
  8. Random selection of test cases.
  9. Read file/stdin option
